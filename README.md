# Shiny-WebPage
My first time building a django project - prototype for the GymTracker

Django debug toolbar added
Urlconfig basics
Started a view or 'template' in Django for  HTML
Adding a launch.json when debugging allows for changing ports -- now 9000

storefront\urls.py has imported INCLUDE
##note to self --  this has given an umbrella or parent for following parts
## i.e. urls can be found as hello IN playground
## see urls.py and urls.py in playground and storefront
